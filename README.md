# WinningJS Todo Sample Application

This is a sample application built for Windows 8 using the [WinningJS] framework. WinningJS integrates the joys of
Node.js development into the process of building Windows 8 apps. So, via the custom build process exemplified here,
you get things like modules from [npm], packaged with [browserify], with beautiful [Stylus] for your CSS and [jade] for
your HTML.

More to come!
